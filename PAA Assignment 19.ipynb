    "The relationship between a class and its instances is a one-to-many partnership. A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It specifies the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that instances of the class will have. An instance, also known as an object, is a specific occurrence or realization of a class. It is created based on the class definition and holds its own unique state and data separate from other instances of the same class. In other words, a class can have multiple instances, each with its own set of data and behavior.\n",

They are defined within the class but outside of any method and can be accessed by all instances of the class. Class methods are functions defined within the class that operate on class-level data or perform actions related to the class as a whole. They can be called on the class itself or its instances. In addition, a class may define static methods or class-specific attributes that provide specific knowledge or behavior related to the class as a whole. The class encapsulates this knowledge and serves as a blueprint for creating instances with the same structure and behavior."

    "A method is a function that is defined within a class and is associated with instances of that class. It is a way to define the behavior of an object and allows objects to perform actions or manipulate their own state. The key difference between a method and a regular function is that a method is implicitly passed the instance it belongs to as the first parameter, conventionally named self. This allows the method to access and modify the instance's attributes and perform operations specific to that instance. In contrast, regular functions are standalone and not tied to any particular class or instance."

    "Q6. How much encapsulation (making instance or class variables private) does Python support?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports a certain level of encapsulation to make instance or class variables private. Conventionally, variables or methods that are intended to be private are prefixed with a single underscore _. This is known as a weak convention for private attributes, indicating that they are intended for internal use within the class or object. However, it does not enforce true privacy as these attributes can still be accessed from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also supports name mangling for stronger encapsulation using a double underscore __ prefix. When a variable or method name starts with __ (double underscore), it undergoes name mangling, where the interpreter rewrites the name to include the class name as a prefix. This makes it harder to access these attributes from outside the class. However, it is important to note that name mangling is more about avoiding accidental name clashes than providing strict privacy, as the attributes can still be accessed using the mangled name.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while Python provides conventions and mechanisms for encapsulation, it promotes a philosophy of \"we are all consenting adults here\" and emphasizes the programmer's responsibility to use the naming conventions and respect the intended usage of attributes and methods."

The self parameter allows the method to reference the specific instance it belongs to, giving access to its instance variables and other methods.\n",

    "Including self in method definitions is essential for proper instance method invocation. When a method is called on an instance (instance.method()), Python automatically passes the instance itself as the first argument to the method.

It is called when the object is being added to an object of another class that does not define its own __add__ method. It allows the object to handle the addition operation when it is the right operand.\n",

    "In summary, __add__ is used for normal addition operations when the object is on the left side, while __radd__ is used when the object is on the right side and the other object does not define its own __add__ method.

    "\n",
    "Reflection methods, also known as introspection methods, are used when we need to examine or manipulate the structure and behavior of objects at runtime.

Reflection methods are necessary when we want to perform tasks such as inspecting an object's properties, dynamically calling methods based on user input, or modifying an object's behavior based on runtime information.\n",

If we have direct access to the class and its methods, and their behavior is known and static, we may not need to use reflection.

Reflection is typically used in cases where we need dynamic and runtime flexibility in interacting with objects.\n",
