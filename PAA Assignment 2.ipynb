    "The relationship between classes and modules in Python is that a module is a file containing Python code, whereas a class is a construct within a module that defines a blueprint for creating objects. Modules can contain one or more classes along with other code, functions, and variables. Classes provide a way to organize and create objects with specific attributes and behaviors within a module."

    "1. Classes and Objects: Understanding the concept of classes and objects is crucial. A class is a blueprint or template that defines the attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) of objects. Objects are instances of classes that are created using the class's constructor.\n",

Encapsulation and Abstraction: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods within a class, providing access to the data through methods while hiding the internal implementation details. Abstraction refers to the concept of representing essential features without including the background complexities. It involves defining interfaces and abstract classes that provide a simplified view of objects and their interactions."
