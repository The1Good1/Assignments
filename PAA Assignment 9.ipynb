    " The change in string types from Python 2.X to Python 3.X can have an impact on our code, especially if we are working with string manipulations and encodings. Some key effects include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Unicode support: Python 3.X strings (str) are Unicode-based by default, whereas Python 2.X had separate string types for Unicode (unicode) and ASCII/byte strings (str). This change affects how we handle and manipulate strings that contain non-ASCII characters.\n",
    "2. Encoding and decoding: In Python 3.X, we need to explicitly encode and decode strings when converting between bytes and Unicode. In Python 2.X, implicit conversions were often performed, leading to potential issues when working with different encodings.\n",
    "3. Print statement: The print statement syntax has changed in Python 3.X, requiring parentheses around the printed expression. For example, print \"Hello\" in Python 2.X becomes print(\"Hello\") in Python 3.X.\n",
