    "It is permissible to use multiple import statements to import the same module in Python. The goal may vary depending on the situation. One possible reason is to have multiple names or aliases for the same module, which can improve code readability or provide convenience when working with the module's contents.\n",

    "\n",
    "Circular importing occurs when two modules import each other, creating a dependency loop. To avoid mutual importing and potential bugs, we can reorganize our code or separate the mutually dependent functionality into a separate module or function. This way, the modules can import the shared functionality without creating circular dependencies.\n",

    "Attaching a program counter to the RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) interpreter application can provide several benefits:\n",
