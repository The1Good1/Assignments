    "Q1. Describe the differences between text and binary files in a single paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text files and binary files differ in how they store and represent data. Text files are human-readable files that store data as a sequence of characters encoded in a specific character encoding (e.g., ASCII, UTF-8). They typically contain plain text data and can be easily opened and edited using text editors. Binary files, on the other hand, store data in a format that is not directly human-readable. They contain sequences of bytes that may represent various data types (e.g., numbers, images, executables) and require specific knowledge of their file structure and data interpretation. Binary files are used for storing non-textual data or when precise control over the data format is required.\n",

    "\n",
    "Text files are a better option when the data primarily consists of textual information, such as storing documents, configuration files, or log files. Text files are easily readable and editable using standard text editors, and their content can be understood by humans. On the other hand, binary files are preferred when dealing with non-textual data, such as images, audio files, video files, or when storing serialized data. Binary files allow for more efficient storage and retrieval of complex data structures and are suitable for use cases that require specific data formats or direct processing by specialized programs or systems.\n",

    "\n",
    "When using binary operations to read and write a Python integer directly to disk, several issues can arise. One common issue is byte order or endianness. Different systems may have different byte orders, which can result in incorrect interpretation of integer values when reading or writing binary data. Additionally, binary operations require explicit handling of the data type's size and format, such as the number of bytes used to represent the integer and the encoding scheme. Mishandling these aspects can lead to data corruption or inaccurate results when reading or writing integers directly as binary data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Using the with keyword in Python to open files has the benefit of automatically managing the file's opening and closing operations. When a file is opened using with, the file object is automatically closed at the end of the block, even if an exception occurs within the block. This ensures that system resources associated with the file, such as file handles, are properly released, preventing resource leaks and improving code reliability. Using with eliminates the need for explicit close() calls and provides a convenient and safer way to handle file operations."

The seek() method allows you to move the file pointer to a specific position within the file, enabling random access. The tell() method returns the current position of the file pointer. With these methods, you can read or write data at specific positions within the file, allowing random access rather than sequential access.\n"

Pickling is useful when we want to preserve the full integrity of the object, including its methods, attributes, and relationships with other objects. Pickled objects can be easily reconstructed later, making it suitable for applications like caching, data persistence, or interprocess communication.\n",

It is best used when we have a large amount of data that we want to persist across different program executions. shelve allows us to store and retrieve objects by using keys, similar to a dictionary.

The shelve module uses strings as the key type internally to identify and retrieve objects. Therefore, when using shelve, we need to ensure that the keys we use to store and retrieve data are strings or can be converted to strings. This restriction distinguishes shelve from other data dictionaries where keys can be of various types, including integers, tuples, or custom objects."
