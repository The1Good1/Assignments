    "The purpose of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a way to structure and organize complex code so that it is easier to write, modify, and maintain. OOP allows us to define custom data types called classes, which encapsulate data and the functions that operate on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using OOP, we can create reusable and modular code that is easier to maintain and extend. OOP also allows for concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism, which can help reduce code duplication and make our code more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, everything is an object, and the language provides powerful features to support OOP. With Python's OOP capabilities, we can create complex applications that are easy to understand and maintain, making it a popular choice for large-scale projects."

    "\n",
    "When an object tries to access an attribute (such as a method or a variable), the interpreter searches for that attribute in a specific order, known as the Method Resolution Order (MRO). The MRO is determined by the inheritance hierarchy of the object's class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inheritance search for an attribute looks for the attribute in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 . The object's own class (also called the instance's class).\n",
    "2 . The classes that the object's class inherits from, in the order that they are listed in the class definition (i.e., left to right).\n",
    "3 . The built-in object class (which all classes inherit from).\n",
    "If the attribute is not found in any of these locations, Python will raise an AttributeError.\n",
