The += operator is used for in-place addition, meaning it modifies the variable in place by adding another value to it. This can be faster than creating a new object and assigning it back to the variable. However, the performance improvement may vary depending on the context and the data types involved. In some cases, the difference in performance may be negligible, while in others, it can be more noticeable."

    "1. Wrapper: A wrapper is a function or class that wraps around another function or class, adding some additional functionality or modifying the behavior. It acts as an intermediary layer between the caller and the wrapped feature. The wrapper typically calls the wrapped feature and may perform additional actions before or after the call.\n",

    "3. Decorator: A decorator is a specific kind of wrapper that uses a particular syntax in Python. Decorators are used to modify the behavior of functions or classes at the time of their definition by applying the @decorator_name syntax. They provide a concise way to add functionality to functions or classes without modifying their source code directly.\n",

This means that they can handle large or infinite sequences of data without the need to generate and store all the values in memory at once.\n",

Generators allow you to iterate over a sequence of values without generating the entire sequence in memory, leading to more efficient memory utilization.\n",
