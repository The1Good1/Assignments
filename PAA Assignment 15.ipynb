    "Q1. What are the new features added in Python 3.8 version?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3.8 introduced several new features and improvements, including:\n",
    "1. Assignment expressions (also known as the \"walrus operator\"): It allows us to assign values to variables as part of an expression using the := operator. For example, x := 5 assigns the value 5 to the variable x.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Positional-only parameters: Function parameters can now be marked as positional-only by using the / separator. This allows defining functions where some parameters can only be passed positionally and not as keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. f-strings support = for self-documenting expressions: f-strings (formatted string literals) gained the ability to include an equal sign (=) after the expression to display the expression itself along with its evaluated value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The math.prod() function: It provides a convenient way to compute the product of a sequence of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The statistics module improvements: The statistics module gained new functions and enhancements for statistical calculations, such as statistics.fmean(), statistics.multimode(), and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. SyntaxWarning suppression: Python 3.8 introduced a new SyntaxWarning category that can be selectively ignored using the -Wignore command-line option or the PYTHONWARNINGS environment variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few highlights, and Python 3.8 includes other improvements like performance enhancements, language syntax enhancements, and library updates. For a comprehensive list of changes, we can refer to the Python 3.8 release notes."

    "Q2. What is monkey patching in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Monkey patching refers to the practice of modifying or extending the behavior of an existing module, class, or object at runtime, without altering its original source code. It involves adding, replacing, or modifying attributes or methods of the object dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, monkey patching is possible due to the language's dynamic nature. We can modify existing classes, functions, or objects by assigning new attributes or redefining existing ones. Monkey patching can be useful for adding functionality, fixing bugs, or adapting existing code to meet specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, monkey patching should be used with caution as it can make code harder to understand, maintain, and debug. It can also introduce unexpected side effects and make code less portable. It is generally recommended to use monkey patching sparingly and only when necessary.\n"

    "Q3. What is the difference between a shallow copy and deep copy?\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy relates to how objects are copied or referenced during the copying process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shallow copy: A shallow copy creates a new object but references the same elements as the original object. In other words, the copy is a new container, but the elements inside the container are still references to the same objects as the original. If the elements are mutable objects, changes made to those objects will be reflected in both the original and the copy. Shallow copying can be performed using the copy() method or the copy module in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Deep copy: A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all the elements of the original object and their nested objects. It creates completely independent copies, so changes made to the elements of the copy will not affect the original object or its elements. Deep copying can be performed using the deepcopy() method or the copy module in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a shallow copy creates a new object with references to the original elements, while a deep copy creates a new object with copies of all the elements and their nested objects."

    "Q4. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier?\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum possible length of an identifier in Python depends on the implementation and version of Python being used. In general, Python allows identifiers (such as variable names, function names, class names, etc.) to be any length. However, there are some practical considerations:\n",
    "1. In Python 3.x, identifiers can be of arbitrary length, limited only by the available memory of the system.\n",
    "2. PEP 8, the official style guide for Python code, recommends limiting line lengths to a maximum of 79 characters. This recommendation applies to identifiers as well, to maintain readability and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that excessively long identifiers can make code harder to read and maintain, so it's generally a good practice to choose meaningful and concise names for variables, functions, classes, and other identifiers."

    "Q5. What is generator comprehension?e more focused on modifying the class definition itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generator comprehension, also known as generator expression, is a concise syntax for creating generators in Python. It allows you to create a generator object using a similar syntax to list comprehensions, but without generating the entire sequence upfront. Generator comprehensions are enclosed in parentheses () instead of square brackets []."

    "\n",
