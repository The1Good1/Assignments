    "The Bayesian interpretation of probability is a framework that assigns probabilities to events or hypotheses based on prior knowledge and incorporates new evidence or data to update those probabilities using Bayes' theorem. It views probability as a measure of uncertainty or degree of belief in a proposition, which can be updated and refined based on observed evidence.\n",

    "The probability of the union of two events, denoted as P(A ∪ B), is the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs. It can be calculated using the equation:\n",

    "Joint probability refers to the probability of two or more events occurring simultaneously. It represents the likelihood of the intersection of events and is denoted as P(A ∩ B), where A and B are events. The formula for joint probability is:\n",

    "The chain rule of probability, also known as the multiplication rule, is a fundamental rule in probability theory that allows the calculation of the joint probability of multiple events by multiplying conditional probabilities. It can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A1 ∩ A2 ∩ ... ∩ An) = P(A1) * P(A2|A1) * P(A3|A1 ∩ A2) * ... * P(An|A1 ∩ A2 ∩ ... ∩ An-1)\n",

    "Continuous random variables are variables that can take on any value within a specified range or interval. They are characterized by a probability density function (PDF), and their outcomes are not restricted to specific discrete values. Examples of continuous random variables include height, weight, temperature, and time.\n",

    "Bernoulli distributions are discrete probability distributions that model a single trial with two possible outcomes: success (usually represented as 1) or failure (usually represented as 0). It is characterized by a parameter p, which represents the probability of success. The probability mass function (PMF) of a Bernoulli distribution is given by:\n",

    "Binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. It is characterized by two parameters: n, the number of trials, and p, the probability of success in each trial. The probability mass function (PMF) of a binomial distribution is given by:\n",

    "Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space when the events occur independently and at a constant average rate. It is characterized by a parameter λ (lambda), which represents the average rate of occurrence. The probability mass function (PMF) of a Poisson distribution is given by:\n",

    "Covariance is a measure of the relationship or dependence between two random variables. It quantifies how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable. It can be calculated as the average of the product of the deviations from the mean of each variable. Mathematically, the covariance between two random variables X and Y is defined as:\n",

    "\n",
    "# Ans 11\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It is a standardized version of covariance and is always between -1 and 1. A correlation coefficient of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship. It measures only the strength of the linear relationship, not other types of relationships.\n",

    "Sampling with replacement is a sampling method where each element in a population has an equal chance of being selected, and after each selection, the selected element is returned to the population before the next selection is made. This means that the same element can be selected multiple times in the sample. For example, drawing cards from a deck and putting each card back before the next draw is an example of sampling with replacement.\n",

    "# Ans 13\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling without replacement is a sampling method where each element in a population has an equal chance of being selected, but once an element is selected, it is not returned to the population. This means that each element can be selected only once in the sample. For example, selecting students from a classroom to form a committee, where once a student is selected, they are not eligible for further selections, is an example of sampling without replacement.\n",

    "In statistics, a hypothesis is a claim or statement about a population or a phenomenon that is subject to investigation or testing. It is formulated based on available information or assumptions and is tested using data and statistical methods. For example, a hypothesis could be that the average weight of adult males is 180 pounds. Hypotheses can be tested using hypothesis testing procedures to determine if there is sufficient evidence to support or reject the hypothesis.\n",
