When the function is called with func(l, m, n), it passes the values of l, m, and n as arguments. Since l is an immutable integer, it is not affected by the function. However, m is a mutable list, so the modification b[0] = 'x' changes the list in place. Similarly, n is a mutable dictionary, so the modification c['a'] = 'y' updates the dictionary. After the function call, l remains 1, m becomes ['x'], and n becomes {'a': 'y'}. Therefore, when l, m, n is printed, it outputs 1 ['x'] {'a': 'y'}."
